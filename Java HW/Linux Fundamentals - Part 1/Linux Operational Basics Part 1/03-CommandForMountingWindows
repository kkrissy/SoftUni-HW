Problem 3 : Command for Mounting Windows
-   What is the command for mounting Windows file system, so that all files belong to a single user? 

  Answer:
  
  -  Linux uses a different convention than Windows for describing disk partitions. A typical example of a Linux partition would be:

     -   /dev/sda2
     This indicates that you installed windows on your SCSI disk on the second partition.

     An IDE hard drive would look something like:

     -  /dev/hda2
     If you have more than one hard disk in your computer, the convention will be different. 
     For example, for the first partition on the second SCSI hard disk would take the form:

     -   /dev/sdb1
     Hopefully by now, you've determined where you installed your Windows file system.

     Next, assuming an NTFS file system, try mounting the partition by typing something like:

      -   mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt     (Of course replacing the /dev/sda1 with your partition specifics.)
     This command should complete without error. If you get an error, you may either not have the file system driver installed correctly 
     or the partition you specified may be incorrect.
